Power Loom
Textile Empire
The Power Loom is an innovative solution to a growing demand for textiles. To automate the weaving process, a shuttle containing a pirn spooled with yarn is rapidly sent back and forth between two perpendicular sets of strung yarn alternating between high and low positions.

In order to operate the Power Loom, pirns spooled with a selected yarn/fiber must be put on the holder located at the side of the machine.

Before the loom can operate, it must be primed with 16 of the selected yarn/fiber by rightclicking with the yarn/fiber on the 'grill' in the center of the machine.

Then, input yarn/fiber can be put with the same method on the lower beam on the machine's shorter side.

Output may be retrieved by a storage device placed in the center of the output side, or by shift-rightclicking on the back.
